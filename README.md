# ML-IoT labs

## Part one
* Setting-up the development environment and discovering the SHL dataset [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/institut-galilee/2022-ml-iot-lab-2/blob/main/1_DiscoveringTheSHLDataset.ipynb)

## Part Two
* Building our first activity recognition models [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/institut-galilee/2021-ml-iot-labs/blob/main/2_BuildingOurFirstActivityRecognitionModels.ipynb)

## Part Three
* https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/android
* An example application for TensorFlow Lite on Android that uses Image classification to continuously classify whatever it sees from the device's back camera. Inference is performed using the TensorFlow Lite Java API. The demo app classifies frames in real-time, displaying the top most probable classifications.
